# NAMASTE Ã— ICD-11 Terminology Service

## Overview

This is a FHIR R4-compliant terminology microservice that integrates India's NAMASTE terminologies with WHO's ICD-11 Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) and biomedicine codes. The service provides a complete solution for healthcare interoperability in India's AYUSH sector, enabling EMR systems to transition from paper-based records to standardized digital health systems.

The application features a modern React frontend with a comprehensive dashboard for terminology search, concept mapping, CSV data ingestion, FHIR bundle validation, and audit tracking. The backend provides RESTful APIs and FHIR-compliant endpoints for terminology operations, with AI-powered mapping suggestions using Google's Gemini AI.
